        # FAQ
        ## How does History Deep Research work?
        When you upload a document, image, or audio file, the system uses multiple AI toolsâ€”like OCR, reverse image search, and LLM-based summarizationâ€”to process and extract information.

        A central agent called **CodeAgent** coordinates tasks between sub-agents such as the Web Browser Agent, File Processor, Literature Finder, and Image Information Agent. These tools help analyze historical content across different media formats.

        ## What makes it different from a regular search engine?
        Unlike a regular search engine, this system uses reasoning steps powered by LLMs to analyze the contentâ€”such as comparing bronze artifacts with historical databases or identifying painting themes using reverse image search and cultural cross-referencing.

        ## Is my data safe?
        Yes, your uploaded data is only used during the session. It is not stored on our servers after the session ends.

        ## Why does it take a while to generate answers?
        Complex questions often involve multiple tools (OCR, translation, image analysis) and multiple LLM calls. If you are using a free OpenAI API key, rate limits may also slow down the response.

        ## How accurate are the answers?
        The answers are based on the best available sources and AI reasoning. However, like any AI system, it can make mistakes, especially if the data is ambiguous or missing context. You should always verify critical findings with primary sources.

        ## What types of files can I upload?
        You can upload PDF, DOCX, PPTX, image files (JPG, PNG), and audio files (MP3, WAV). The system will automatically route them to the appropriate agents for processing.

        ## What is CodeAgent?
        CodeAgent is the manager that coordinates different tools in the SmolAgent framework. It ensures that each taskâ€”like image recognition, document analysis, or web searchâ€”is assigned to the right agent.
